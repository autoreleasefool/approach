<b>v3.2.0</b>
A lot of users have been having issues with the current transfer functionality, so I've created a new process which will let you export and save the data wherever you'd like, and then import it on a new device. Hopefully this helps those with longstanding issues of being unable to move to new devices.

This update also comes with some quality of life fixes:
- No more ads
- No more analytics

<b>v3.1.2</b>
- Fixed a crash some users experienced when trying to open a game

- Fixed sharing games through the game overview
- Prevented scores from dropping below zero when there are too many fouls

<b>v3.1.0</b>
Thank you for using the app while some of the kinks in the new version are worked out!
- See an overview of your games by tapping the list icon in the top right, or the overview menu item
- Share games and series from the game overview (saving to external storage required)

<b>v2.1.4</b>

<i>What's new</i>
- Added THIS popup, to inform you of the newest changes each release.
- Leagues now have a "base average". Start recording a new league in the middle of a season? Long click a league, select "Change properties" and you can set your average so far and the number of games you've played, so your average in the app is more accurate.
- You can now duplicate a series. Duplicating a series will create a new series for the current date, with the same number of games and scores as the series you duplicate. This new series will use manually set games, and will affect your average, but no other stats.
- New statistics: percentage of time that your first ball is left or right of the headpin. Find them under "General"

<i>Other changes</i>
- Added an option to move the pins above the "next" button, instead of behind it, to prevent misclicks. This option is enabled by default.
- Fixed an issue where changing the name of a league or event sometimes added an "L" or "E" to the start. If this happened to you, you'll receive a pop-up asking if you'd like the names to be fixed.
