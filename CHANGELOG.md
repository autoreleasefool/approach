```

## Android v3.2.0

```
A lot of users have been having issues with the current transfer functionality, so I've created a new process which will let you export and save the data wherever you'd like, and then import it on a new device. Hopefully this helps those with longstanding issues of being unable to move to new devices.

This update also comes with some quality of life fixes:
- No more ads
- No more analytics
```

## v3.1.2

```
- Fixed a crash some users experienced when trying to open a game
```

## v3.1.1

```
This version contains a bunch of bug fixes! Here's just a few:
- Creating or opening an event should no longer crash the app
- Fixed sharing games through the game overview
- Prevented scores from dropping below zero when there are too many fouls
```

## v3.1.0

```
Thank you for using the app while some of the kinks in the new version are worked out!
- See an overview of your games by tapping the list icon in the top right, or the overview menu item
- Share games and series from the game overview (saving to external storage required)

Bug fixes
- Lefts and rights are now reported correctly
- Return to the first incomplete game when editing a series (not just the first game)
- Fix some more rotation crashes and returning to the app from the background
```

## v3.0.2

```
This update contains a tonne of stability fixes for the new version.

- Fix pins not appearing for some users
- Fix crash when rotating the device
- "Middle hits which were strikes" now counts denominator accurately
- Some other stability bug fixes
```

## v3.0.0

```
Welcome to the new 5 Pin Bowling Companion. We completely rebuilt the app from scratch with all your favourite features and plenty of new ones.

- Teams
    - Create a team of bowlers to track together
    - Pick your team and select a league for each bowler
    - Change their order
    - Pressing the next ball button will take you to the next bowler! Keep an eye on whose name is at the top of the screen
- Highlight settings are now per league â€” long press to edit
- New statistics
```

## v2.1.9

```
- Stability fixes for Android Oreo
- Fix bugs with "Combine Series"
- Better font scaling for accessibility
- Auto lock games after final frame is complete
- List rows are larger for easier clicking
- H+2 is now counted as a Headpin, and Split + 2 is a split
- Allow more characters in bowler and league names
- Redesign series screen to avoid overlapping scores
```

## v2.1.8

```
- See your average with up to 1 decimal place by going to Settings > Statistics.
```

## v2.1.7

```
- Transfer your data to a new device! By accessing the "Transfer data" option in the menu, you can transfer your data to a new device by uploading it to our servers and downloading it elsewhere with your unique code.

```

## v2.1.6

```

```

```

## v2.1.4

```
What's new
- Added THIS popup, to inform you of the newest changes each release.
- Leagues now have a "base average". Start recording a new league in the middle of a season? Long click a league, select "Change properties" and you can set your average so far and the number of games you've played, so your average in the app is more accurate.
- You can now duplicate a series. Duplicating a series will create a new series for the current date, with the same number of games and scores as the series you duplicate. This new series will use manually set games, and will affect your average, but no other stats.
- New statistics: percentage of time that your first ball is left or right of the headpin. Find them under "General"

Other changes
- Added an option to move the pins above the "next" button, instead of behind it, to prevent misclicks. This option is enabled by default.
- Fixed an issue where changing the name of a league or event sometimes added an "L" or "E" to the start. If this happened to you, you'll receive a pop-up asking if you'd like the names to be fixed.
