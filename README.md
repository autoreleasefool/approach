Your 5 Pin Bowling Companion is here!

Use this app to track scores of all your games frame-by-frame and view detailed statistics about every bowler, league, series or game that you include! With options to add special one-time events and tournaments, or a new series to a league each and every week, you'll be able to track everything that helps you succeed as a bowler.

This app is also open source. Feel free to check out the repository at https://github.com/joseph-roque/bowling-companion to see the source and even contribute. In addition, as you request and I plan new features, you'll be able to view their progress any time, so long as you understand what you're doing over at GitHub.
